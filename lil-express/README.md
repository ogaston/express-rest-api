ðŸš€ [Get started with Lil Express](https://github.com/ogaston/express-rest-api)

## Documentation

The Lil-Express is a small repository to use together [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) to get easier to create Controllers and Routes.

It's as simple as:

```javascript

const lil = require('./lil-express')

const authorRoute = lil.createRoute(Author, "Author")

```

> In this case the *Author* variable is a MongoDB model.
