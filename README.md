## Documentation

The Lil-Express is a small repository to use together [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) to get easier to create Controllers and Routes.

It's as simple as:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const authorRouter = require('./routes/genericRoutes')(Author, "Author")

```

You must require the genericRoute.js file, and call the inmidiatly function with the Modal object, and the name as string
